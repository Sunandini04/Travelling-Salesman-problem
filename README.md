# Travelling Salesman Problem

**Objective:**

The objective of the Traveling Salesman Problem is to minimize the total distance (or cost) traveled by the salesman while visiting all cities exactly once and returning to the starting city.


**Implementation**

**Input**

**-** The number of cities.

**-** Weighted adjacency matrix representing distances between cities. 

**-** If there is no direct connection between two cities, a large value (typically infinity) is used.

**Output**

**-** The optimal tour that visits all cities exactly once and returns to the starting city.

**-** The total cost of the tour, which is the sum of distances traveled.
